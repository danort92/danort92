- 👋 Hi, I’m Danilo, italian guy who studied Energy Engineering at Polytecnic Institute of Milan with working experiences in the energy and medical sectors.
- 👀 I’m interested in renewable energies, MedTech and, generally speaking, everything that could create a positive impact to society and environment. Passionate about space, photography and football too. 
- 🌱 I've always been a tech nerd and I’m currently learning Data Science, thanks to a professional path held by [ProfessionAI] (https://www.linkedin.com/company/professionai/), an italian startup involved in e-learning services, through which I am studying Statistics, Machine Learning, SQL, Deep Learning, Artificial Intellingence, Neural networks and programming with R and Python. I really think this is the future for every company!
- 💞️ I would love to be a remote worker in Data Science. Having said that, I strongly believe in the ethical part of work and for this reason I would like to collaborate in projects that could change lives for the better: medical science, renewables, circular economy, redistribution of wealth, 
democratization of education, animal rights, environment protection, etc... Space, photography and football sectors would be great too, being passions I have since I was a child!
