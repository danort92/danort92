- 👋 Hi, I’m Danilo, italian guy who studied Energy Engineering at Polytecnic Institute of Milan with working experiences in the energy and medical sectors.
- 👀 I’m interested in SDGs topics AI for Good and Animal Advocacy, generally speaking everything that could create a positive impact to society, environment and animal rights. Passionate about nature photography and animal activism. 
- 🌱 I've always been a tech nerd and I’ve recently completed a Data Science master, thanks to a professional path held by [ProfessionAI](https://www.profession.ai/), an italian startup involved in e-learning services, through which I am studying Statistics, Machine Learning, SQL, Deep Learning, Artificial Intellingence, NLP, Neural networks, Big Data, Data visualization techniques and programming with R and Python. I really think this is the future for every company!
- 💞️ I would love to be a remote worker in Data Science working for ethical companies. I would like to collaborate in projects that could change lives for the better: medical science, renewables, circular economy, redistribution of wealth, 
democratization of education, animal rights, environment protection, etc... Space, photography and football projects would be interesting too, being passions I have since I was a child.
